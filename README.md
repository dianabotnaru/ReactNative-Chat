=================================================

This project shows a full React Native chat app ready to be deployed onto Android or iOS, complete with the server component.

## Getting Started

In order to use this you need to register with http://pusher.com and to add a `pusher.json` file to both the `server` and `client` directories. This file should look like:

```json
{
    "appId":"SOME_APP_ID",
    "key":"SOME_APP_KEY",
    "secret":"SOME_APP_SECRET",
    "cluster":"eu",
    "encrypted":true,
    "restServer":"http://192.168.0.15:4000"
}
```

Note that the `restServer` property needs to point to the Server component when it is running, and is only needed in the `client` version of the file.

Running the server
------------------
The server can be built by executing "npm install" inside the `server` directory. 
The server can then be run by executing "node index.js" from the same directory. By default this starts on port 4000.

Running the client
------------------
The client can be built by executing "npm install" inside the `client` directory.
The client can then be run by executing "npm start" inside the same directory and following the on-screen prompts to access it from your mobile device.
